# etl-extract
## Project description
This project is one part of a super project and is part of a so-called ETL pipeline.
It should represent the entire extraction process and be able to run as a standalone software system, independent of the other processes such as the transform and load process.
I want to achieve better maintainability and expandability for the future.
